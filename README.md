# Requirements

For final project, you are requested to build a car racing simulation. You are requested to create two cars and animate them as they are racing during one lap. You may create a model for your car, or you can download models and import them into 3Ds Max. But, the models have to be textured. The following components are necessary to build: 

* Two cars
* Road:
  * A path to serve as racing track. The curves on the path are custom, but it has to be a loop. 
* Lights:
  * Depending on your design, apply appropriate light to lit the race. 
* Cameras: 
  * One camera mounted on the roof of one of the cars, facing forward. 
  * The other camera is mounted in front of the other car, but facing backward such that we have a front view of the car as it is racing. 
  * The third camera provides us a top view of the whole scene.
* Physics:
  * You are requested to include physics into your simulation to take care of collisions.
* Particle System: Create and apply an appropriate particle system to simulate the celebration after the match is over. This particle system will start as soon as the first car passes the “finish” line.

To demonstrate your project, create the simulation as follows: 
At the beginning, we will have a global view of the scene as the two cars are waiting behind the start-line. Once the race begins, you will need to switch the camera to one of the cars. During the race, you are supposed to switch between cameras mounted inside the cars. The switching frequency depends on the design of your simulation. However, you need to switch to cameras to provide different views and make the simulation more exciting.
